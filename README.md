My own place to practice algorithms i found in books or other sites that are interesting enough to keed record of my pain when I solved them, or just purely exercises to learn how different lenguages solve it differently.


## Simple exercises

## Glossary

*Binary Search Tree*: In computer science, binary search trees (BST), sometimes called ordered or sorted binary trees, are a particular type of container: data structures that store "items" (such as numbers, names etc.) in memory.
They allow fast lookup, addition and removal of items, and can be used to implement either dynamic sets of items, or lookup tables that allow finding an item by its key (e.g., finding the phone number of a person by name).
